# KNN_Classifier
This is a basic Machine Learning Algorithm to classify a set of images

- L1Dist is used to calculate the distance between images.

Dataset:
========
Dogs: 1000, Cats: 1000, Pandas: 1000

- Training dataset: 70%
- Validation Dataset: 10%
- Test Dataset: 20%

Go through "Repeat.pdf" to get a clear picture of algorithm that I coded.

Note: Avoided using in-built functions to improve the real coding experience.
