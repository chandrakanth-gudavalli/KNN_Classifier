# KNN_Classifier
A basic Machine Learning Algorithm to classify a set of images

L1Dist is used to calculate the distance between images.

Training dataset: 70%
Validation Dataset: 10%
Test Dataset: 20%

Go through "Repeat.pdf" to get a clear picture of algorith that I coded.

Note: Avoided using in-built functions to improve the real coding experience.
